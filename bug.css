The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS, but sometimes unexpected results can occur due to operator precedence or unit mismatch. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 10px + 5%);` might not produce the expected result due to the order of operations.  Another common issue is forgetting units.  `width: calc(100% - 10);` is incorrect as the second term is missing units (it needs to be `10px` or similar).
